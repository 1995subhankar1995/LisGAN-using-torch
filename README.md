Implementation of "Leveraging the Invariant Side of Generative Zero-Shot Learning" paper
I stopped the code at 102 epochs, because the accuricies are almost converged for AWA2 dataset. If you choose to test it on other dataset, please change the name in "parser.dataset". argparse do not work in the colab, so i converted it into class and passed all values.https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04092.pdf
